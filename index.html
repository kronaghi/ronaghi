        Welcome to the online home of Kambiz Ronaghi.

        A dedicated and self-driven computer programmer, I have honed my skills through independent learning and
        extensive practical experience. I have developed a strong command of multiple programming languages, including
        FoxPro, C#, Python, and C++, applying my knowledge to create a diverse range of programs. With a keen eye for
        user experience and interface, I also work as a front-end programmer, building engaging and functional web
        interfaces.

        Beyond the world of code, I was also a passionate Mathematics teacher, specializing in the fundamental and
        intricate areas of Geometry, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. I am dedicated to sharing my
        understanding and helping others navigate the logical structures and problem-solving techniques within these
        fields.

        This page serves as a window into my multifaceted expertise, showcasing my journey in both the dynamic
        realm of programming and the enduring world of mathematics.</p>
